The list is stored securely, allowing the user to retrieve and modify it as needed.
Add Items:
Users can add new items to their list with ease. This feature ensures that the list grows as users continue to add new tasks or goals.

The edit function allows users to modify their list items. They can update details or change the description as necessary.
Delete Items:
Users have the option to remove any item from the list if it's no longer needed, providing flexibility and control over their content.
Made with React Native:
The app is built using React Native, ensuring that it works smoothly on both Android and iOS devices. This cross-platform development tool allows for a consistent experience across various devices.
The overall goal of iHat is to offer an intuitive, secure, and efficient way for users to organize and manage their personal lists, with the flexibility to edit and update as needed. React Native's power enables the site to deliver a high-quality mobile app experience.
